### `T18` Method (Nuking)
#### This document explains the `T18`Nuking Method, An advanced method which is botless.

##### This is still just a concept, It is planned to be implemented in 4xel3.0a and beyond.

#### Chapter One. (Intoduction)
Bot accounts and User accounts are fairly similar, In most nuking methods you require a bot to run the nuke code, But how does one get a bot into a server? `MNP` is outdated and `BMOD` is very hard to do, So `T18`fixes this, Bot accounts are just like user accounts, but they don't have a username or password. They have a unique token which can be used in the API, But bot accounts are very similar to user accounts, So shouldn't they have one too?

#### Chapter Two. (Self-bots)
Yes, They do have one. It may not be as easy to obtain as the bot token, but it exists, By using a token-logger you can grab tokens and use them ONLY in activated copies of 4xel. By getting into a server and then seeing who is the owner, You can token-log them and use their token in 4xel, This would make their account into a bot account and you could be able to run whatever code you want on their account. Such as 4xel.
